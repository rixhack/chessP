I started coding today. I've encountered quite a few problems but the first sandbox chessboard is working. It includes creation of a new game, alternative turns, reading moves from input with a sort of extended algebraic notation and performing them and a board display in console using upper and lowercasing to difference black and white pieces and hypens to denote empty squares. The program is written in c language and it is quite pointer and struct based. By now I'm asking myself why am I writing in English and coding in Spanish. I should fix that soon.

Just fix minor problems and add two new functionalities: checking the correctness of the input move and only allow the player to move his own pieces.
